# Login-system
This is a custom login system created in PHP OOP.
Which contains a lot functionalities like: Validation , Unique email, password confirmation, crop images and more...
Dynamic part is profile page where you can update account and change default profile image with a custom image.
The interesting part is that when you delete the profile picture, the default picture will be set automatically.
I have build a class to crop images with jpeg and png extensions trying to make square profile images to provide a profile picture as professional as possible.
At the same page you can update password .
