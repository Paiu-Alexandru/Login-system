# Login-system
This is a custom login system created in PHP OOP.<br />
Which contains a lot functionalities like: Validation , Unique email, password confirmation, crop images and more...<br />
Dynamic part is profile page where you can update account and change default profile image with a custom image.<br />
The interesting part is that when you delete the profile picture, the default picture will be set automatically.<br />
I have build a class to crop images with jpeg and png extensions trying to make square profile images to provide a profile picture as professional as possible.<br />
At the same page you can update password .
